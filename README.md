Welcome to my Unity learning projects repository! This repo is a collection of various prototypes and mini-games that I’ve developed to learn and improve my Unity game development skills. Each folder contains a unique Unity project focusing on different aspects of game development, including movement mechanics, shooting mechanics, platformers, and more.



1) Prototype 1: Basic Movement
This project focuses on creating a simple player movement system, with basic controls and physics integration for a beginner-friendly introduction to Unity development.
Skills learned:
Character controller
Basic player input
Unity’s physics system

2) Prototype 2: Shooting Mechanic
In this prototype, I implemented a simple shooting mechanic for a 2D/3D game. The goal was to understand how to work with projectiles and collisions.
Skills learned:
Shooting projectiles
Collision detection
Event handling
Instantiation

4) Prototype 3: Platformer
A classic 2D platformer prototype, focusing on creating a small level with player movement, jumping, and basic platforming mechanics.
Skills learned:
Platformer mechanics (jumping, walking)
Collisions and triggers
Animation integration
Particle and Sound effects
